### *"This year has been extra-code-inary for me!"*
---

It all started when I saw my friend [Suhas](https://suhas2go.github.io/) contributing to [Picard](https://picard.musicbrainz.org/) for Google Summer of Code. Out of sheer curiosity I began to contribute to GNOME. I chose [Music](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Music/) since I had some experience[^1] with GTK in python.

### I also aimed to get GSoC but this is life, it can't be that easy...
---

It turned out that Music was not going to participate in GSoC 2017 because [Marinus Schraal](https://wiki.gnome.org/MarinusSchraal/), its maintainer was busy this summers.

### The rescue
---

I looked into [Games](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Games/). I was mesmerised by the code's beauty! With the help of its awesome maintainer [Adrien Plazas](https://wiki.gnome.org/AdrienPlazas/) I was able to quickly adapt and start hacking. I began to solve and find bugs with full speed, and as a reward Adrien and Marinus recommended me for a developer access. I got a **src.gnome.org** email-id and the power (+responsibity) to push my patches to **any** GNOME project! This had to be the greatest news ever but...

I even got [selected](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5453524386185216) for GSoC. I am so happy that I applied in GNOME! I had been using the applications and libraries for so long, I can finally give back to the community which gave us the most beautiful desktop environment ever :D

My project is to add [Gamepad and Keyboard Configuration to Games](https://wiki.gnome.org/Outreach/SummerOfCode/2017/Projects/AbhinavSingh_GamesGamepadConfiguration). I am looking forward to an interesting summer. I will certainly learn a lot!
